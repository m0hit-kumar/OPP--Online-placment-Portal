**INTRODUCTION ABOUT PROJECT**

**1.1 DESCRIPTION**

As we know, we all talk about progress and development, following the concept of digitalization in evolving world. this platform has been designed to eliminate the complexity of manual system.  To provide transparency and single layer function between students and placement cell. Moreover, this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner.
This application will make the work smooth and convenient for the students and faculty as well. The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data. It also provides error message while entering valid data. Every organization, whether big or small, has challenges to overcome and managing the information of students which somehow can lead to for a student to miss an opportunity.
This application has designed to fulfill the basic placement process requirement of notifying students all at one time. The traditional method of informing the students through mail and message lacking somewhere making the process complex involving three-layer system but with the help of this application we ensure to work smoothly and make sure to keep in sight of students about their secured future.

**1.2 REASONS FOR SELECTION OF THIS PROJECT** 

•	Awareness: To make students aware of on – campus placement and making it more interactive.

•	Efficient: This involves accuracy, timelessness and comprehensiveness of the output.

•	Portability: The platform should be portable on all environment.

•	To reduce the complexity of workflow of placement process.

**OBJECTIVES OF PROJECT WORK**
 
Placement is obligatory for most of students, students graduate with a hope of having a secure job in their hand in the end of time. When any placement drives students are being informed by 
their respective department’s faculty or by campus placement cell which makes the process limited in between final year students and faculty, due to which many students lack in deciding their dream company & preparing for future placement. 
This is a platform where students can register themselves and check all the arrival of companies in  their campus which may help them in com paring in their minds about their desired company.
 This platform is open to every student creating a transparency about the handsome opportunities providing by the university to them.

**METHODOLOGY USED**

**1. ER DIAGRAM:-**
      
 An **Entity Relation** (ER) Diagram is a specialized graphics that illustrates the interrelationship between entities in a database. ER diagrams often use symbols to represent 3 different types of information. Boxes are commonly used to represent entities. Diamonds are normally used to represent relationships and ovals are used to represent attributes.
 An **Entity Relationship Model** (ERM), in software engineering is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity Relationship modeling is a relational schema database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relation database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. 

•Entity: Entity is the thing which we want to store information. It is an elementary basic building block of storing information about business process. An entity represents an object defined within the information system about which you want to store information. Entities are distinct things in the enterprise.

**2 Data Flow Diagrams:-**

• **Relationships**: A relationship is a named collection or association 
between entities or used to relate two or more entities with some common attributes or meaningful interaction between the objects.

• **Attributes**: Attributes are the properties of the entities and relationship, Descriptor of the entity. Attributes are elementary pieces of information attached to an entity.
A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** is a diagram that describes the flow of data and the processes that change or transform data throughout a system. The Data Flow Diagram reviews the current physical system prepares input and output specifications specifies the implementation plan etc.
Four basic symbols are used to construct data flow diagrams. They are symbols that represent data sources, data flows, and data transformation and data storage. The points at which data are transformed are represented by enclosed figures, usually circles, which are called nodes.

**2 Descriptions of Obtained Result**

This application will provide access publicly to all semester students displaying the on-campus placement their opportunity which motivate them to decide their desired company and prepare themselves earlier.
This application is one of its’ kind which displays the all the necessary details offered by the arrived company (i.e. designation, package, location) clarifying the picture to students to choose their desired job and applying for it.

**FUTURE SCOPE** 

The future scope of the platform is that it will provide the convenience to the students and aspirants to upload their documents and resume on this, and moreover can compare different companies through our data analysis which will enlighten them about the average packages and average number of students they hire in each session even will get some basic traits on which the company searches its candidates.


The students and aspirants will also get notified about their placement schedule through notifications on a regular basis. For future we are even planning to conduct aptitude exams for companies on our platform, also planning for uploading preparation material and that will be made available for all the semester students 
All in all our platform will create and ease for aspirants so that the process becomes more swift and easy.
